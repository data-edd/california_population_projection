# California Population Projection - SQL Data Analysis

This project demonstrates a population projection analysis for the state of California using MySQL. The goal is to predict the population growth over a given period based on historical data and demographic trends.

The project involves extracting, transforming, and visualizing population data from multiple datasets to generate meaningful insights and trends about California's population. SQL is the primary tool for data extraction and manipulation, while the analysis helps to predict future population estimates.

## Project Overview

In this project, the analysis focuses on:
- **Historical population data**: Analyzing past census data.
- **Population growth projections**: Estimating future population growth based on historical trends.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Using SQL queries to preprocess and prepare data for analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Creating graphs and charts to showcase population trends.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

### 1. **SQL Queries & Data Preparation**  
The core of the project involves various SQL queries designed to clean and manipulate the data. The queries are stored in `.sql` files and focus on:
- Extracting population data from the database.
- Aggregating data by year, age group, gender, etc.
- Generating projections for future population based on historical trends.

### 2. **Data Analysis and Projections**  
Once the data is cleaned and structured, we perform population projections using SQL-based calculations. We use statistical techniques like linear regression or growth factors to estimate population growth.

### 3. **Visualization**  
Data visualization tools are used to generate graphs and charts that display population trends, growth projections, and demographic distribution.

### 4. **Database Schema**  
The database schema includes tables with information on population by various demographics (age, gender, ethnicity) and historical data. The schema and data structure are outlined in this section.

## Getting Started
